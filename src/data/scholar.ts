  rationale: `During my bachelor's degree, I stay in many private hostels. I interview many hostel owners on the need for a software application that helps them manage their hostels.
    After getting the requirements from the hostel owners, I decided to build Scholar. At completion I was able to sell the application to many hostel owners.
